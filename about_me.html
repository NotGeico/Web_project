		<h2>Short introduction</h2>
		<p class="border02">Hello! My name is Diego Rivas I am a student at Valencia college and I am studying in graphic design for web and print. I was born in the united states of America in this little known place called Orlando Florida. Though I was born in the states my family are actually from central America this actual little known place called Honduras. at a very young age I moved to Honduras and studied over there  </p>

	<div class="column">
		<h2>My early life </h2>
		<p class="border02">In Honduras I lived in two different houses one with my parents in the city called Juticalpa and with my grandma for the weekends in a small village called "El Higuerito" I spent most of my childhood there but for context this place isn't very safe you should not show off any jewelry or any expensive electronics around because you will get robbed I know a thing or two because I have seen a thing or two and don't get me started on the wildlife this place is just a safe place to be and so once I was 7 with hope for me to receive a education my mom and I moved back to the united states and  started school on the third grade I have been studying here in the US since</p>

		<h2>Two truths and a lie! </h2>
		<p class="border02">lets play a little game! I will give you two truths about me and one lie you have to figure out what the lie is</p>
		<ul class="ttl">
			<li>I learned to drive when I was 9 years old and have also crashed a car when I was 10</li>
			<li>I have had snakes fall on me while trying to enter my room</li>
			<li>I have never broken a bone before</li>

<p id="a3" style="display:none">It was the third option! I have fortunately never broken a bone before but it is unfortunate that I crashed a car at such a early age into a fencepost ;-; and that I have dealt with snakes falling on me</p>
