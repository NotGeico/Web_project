	  <h2>This is my website that I made myself to promote myself</h2>
		<p class="border">This is a website coded entirely by me myself and I with the use of HTML and CSS. What is Html and CSS? HTML is the backbone of any web page, providing the structure and content. It uses a system of elements or "tags" to define parts of a web page.HTML organizes the content of a page but does not control how it looks. Think of HTML as the framework or skeleton of a building—it’s the structure on which everything else is built. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation and design of the HTML content. It adds style, layout, and visual appeal to web pages. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them.</p>
